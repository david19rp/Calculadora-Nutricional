# Calculadora-Nutricional
In this project , I'm going to create a calculator that is going to take the  following inputs of the users:
  - height
  - weight
  - waist
  - neck
  - Hip (women only)
  - sex
  
 Beside those inputs, I'm going to add the data that the users give related to the a "activity Level" , the inputs of 
 these activity are:
 
  - Sedentary
  - Moderate
  - Active
  
  Once the app take all the data from the user, we are going to  output the following info:
  
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Waist / Height Index
  - Percent Body Fat
  - Lean Body Mass
  
  So basically the idea is to work in a calculator that is going to show to the user the info above, for this project
  I'm going to use jquery and bootstrap v4.
